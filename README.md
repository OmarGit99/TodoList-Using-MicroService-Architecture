# TodoList-Using-MicroService-Architecture
Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: For developing the microservices

Docker: For containerizing each microservice and creating a consistent development environment.

Kubernetes: For orchestrating the microservices and managing scalability.

CI/CD System (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Travis CI): For automating the build, test, and deployment process.

TDD: For implementing unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of each microservice.

Programming Language:Java.

Project Steps:

Design the Microservices Architecture:

Define the microservices needed for the application (e.g., user service, task service, notification service).
Plan the communication between microservices (e.g., RESTful APIs or gRPC).
Implement Microservices:

Develop each microservice with its specific functionality.
Write unit tests and integration tests for each microservice following TDD principles.
Dockerize Microservices:

Create Dockerfiles for each microservice to containerize them.
Build Docker images for each microservice.
Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:

Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or a cloud provider (e.g., GKE, EKS, or AKS).
Deploy Microservices on Kubernetes:

Deploy each microservice to the Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes YAML files.
Set up services and ingresses for inter-service communication.
Implement CI/CD Pipeline:

Choose a CI/CD system and set up a pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
Configure the pipeline to trigger on code commits and automatically build, test, and deploy the microservices.
Implement Frontend:

Develop a frontend for the web application using a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
The frontend should interact with the microservices through their APIs.
Add User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using technologies like JWT or OAuth.

Test the Application:

Run end-to-end tests to ensure the entire application works as expected.
Monitor and Scale the Application:

Set up monitoring and logging for the application using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Implement autoscaling for the microservices to handle varying loads.
Deploy the Application:

Deploy the fully functional application on the Kubernetes cluster.
